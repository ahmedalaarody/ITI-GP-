## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Improved Readability**: Code is now cleaner and easier to read
2. **Reduced File Size**: Removed unnecessary comments and whitespace

## Testing Recommendation

After cleanup, test all functionality to ensure nothing was broken:
- Login functionality
- Product listing, adding, editing, and deleting
- Navigation between pages
- Toast notifications
- Image display
- Profile page

All functionality should work exactly as before, but with cleaner, more readable code.
